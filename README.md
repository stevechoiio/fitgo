FitGO is a web application that gives users more convenient access to personal trainers nearby. The main feature of the application is a map that will help users filter personal trainers by distance and by skills. Users will see personal trainers' information and can favour the trainers. Personal trainers have a profile page where they can see a list of users that have favored them.
